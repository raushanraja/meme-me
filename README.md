# MEME ME!

Make a meme as beautiful as you are!

A forkable, hackable project built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev),
[Pico.css](https://picocss.com) & Vanilla JS at
[FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com)

- Initial Demo: [anjana.dev/meme-me](https://anjana.dev/meme-me)
- This project builds on it, and for now just draws a box around face.
